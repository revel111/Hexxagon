# Hexxagon
The game "Hexxagon" written on C++ using SFML library 

Copy of the famous brainstorming game "Hexxagon", but as a window application written on C++ with the help of the SFML library. The game has two modes: player vs. player and player vs computer. 
Classical gameplay with the possibility to save and load games + save files managment i.e. you can delete save files, rewrite them etc. Of course, there is a possibility to check high scores.
High score calculation is based on difference between amount of pawns of player 1 and player 2.
